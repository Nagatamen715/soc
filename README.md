This is the SOC Record of Consultation form. The original request was to convert the included pdf to be a sendable pdf. After discussing with the client it became apparent that the pdf functionality might not work in the way they wanted to use the form. So we offered both a simple email submission form and a more complex database application. The client chose the email form. 

The client has changed their mind multiple times as to what they want the form to do, so the layout and included fields have changed multiple times. Currently the layout is being finalized by the client and then error handling will be added.
